# INTERN MATCH 👩‍💻🔍💼

INTERNMATCH is a command-line application developed by a group of second-year students from ENSAI. The purpose of this application is to facilitate their future internship searches. 🚀
## Objective 🎯

The objective of INTERNMATCH is to provide users with a convenient way to search for internships on various internship platforms such as Hellowork, welcometothejungle, and more. The application allows users to search for internships based on their preferences and filter them by different specialties such as computer science, data analysis, machine learning, etc. 🌐💡
Authenticated users have the additional functionality to save interesting internships to their "wishlist" within the application. They can also choose to respond to job offers automatically or retrieve employer contacts for easy application submission. The application keeps a record of user navigation and search history. 📝💼🔖

There are two types of authenticated users: "student" and "professor." An "administrator" role is also available to manage the application and its users. By default, unauthenticated users are categorized as "students." It is expected that the needs of professors and students will differ. 👩‍🎓👨‍🎓👨‍🏫👩‍🏫
